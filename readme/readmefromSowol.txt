Thank you for the reading the readme!
I didn't watned to put everything on the website, such as information page or the about page.
because it really doesn't fit with my website at least I thought like that, so I decided to put the readme outside of the website!
I don't want to explain everything about the website, if I explain everything I feel like it isnt private one anymore.
but I know, this is assignment and it would be assessed.
Thats why I made the readme here!
You can use play button to play, and also going to previous one and next one with the buttons as well.
you can turn off the device, and mute it as well.
right buttons are changing the theme of the guitar, left button is changing the random backgrounds.
the small timelines near to the right button is the time when I played the song.
Thank you for reading, and please enjoy!
